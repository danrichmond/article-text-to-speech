# article-text-to-speech
Convert an article to mp3.

Run the readToMe.py file with python3 in your terminal. It will ask you for the article's URL then to give the new mp3 file a name. One it is complete, you can find the mp3 file in the same directory as the readToMe.py file.

I used BeautifulSoup to pull the text from the page along with gTTS to create the mp3 file.

Requirements: 
  1. Python3
  2. BeautifulSoup4
  3. gtts
